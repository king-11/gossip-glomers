# Unique Id Generation

This implementation generates unique IDs using a combination of the current epoch time, source node ID, destination node ID, and a counter. The approach ensures that IDs are unique across distributed nodes.

I have written a dedicated walkthrough of my solution on my [blog](https://blog.king-11.dev/posts/unique-id-generator/).
